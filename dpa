Query-Level Performance Analysis
Unlike many tools that focus only on server metrics, DPA provides deep visibility into SQL query execution, waits, and bottlenecks.


Wait-Time Analysis
It uses a unique wait-time methodology to pinpoint the root cause of performance issues, which is more actionable than CPU/memory metrics alone.


Cross-Platform Support
Supports multiple relational database engines in a single pane of glass, ideal for heterogeneous environments.


Lightweight Architecture
Agentless monitoring reduces overhead on production systems compared to agent-based tools.


Integration & Reporting
Built-in integration with SolarWinds Orion platform and detailed historical trend analysis for capacity planning.
